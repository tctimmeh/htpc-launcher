|appName|
=============

|appName| is a program for launching full-screen applications. It is designed for use in an environment where only
one of several resource-intensive applications should be run at once. |appName| responds to
LIRC [#lirc]_ key presses by starting a configured application and stopping any others that may
still be running.

For example, if |appName| is configured for `XBMC <http://xbmc.org/>`_ and `Steam <http://steampowered.com/>`_,
then pressing the configured LIRC key for XBMC will launch that program. Next, if the button for Steam is pressed,
|appName| will shut down XBMC and launch Steam.

This document describes how to install, configure, and use |appName|.
